## App Description

This simple Calorie Calculator app is designed to help us become more aware of
our daily caloric intake. Whether we're planning to lose or maintain a healthy weight,
it's absolutely necessary to be provided with the essential information needed first
so we can know what are the next healthy steps to take. This app sufficiently provides that
need by first calculating the Body Mass Index(BMI)/Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR) and then calculating
the estimated daily caloric intake for both weight loss and weight maintenance. Plus an average BMI is displayed with respect to the user's age. By using the Calorie Calculator, we can see that the key
to a healthy life all starts with simple daily steps!
